# Food Desert

## Motivation

Food Desert is a personal project of mine I've been thinking about a while. I wanted to map food security in New York City. I saw that [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) had an [Isochrone feature](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-isochrone-api/) and I figured this would be a great way to map how grocery store accessibility. This was also an excuse to familiarize myself with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Tech Stack

This application was constructed using the follow tech stack:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)

## Features

A fresh isochrone is generated by clicking anywhere on the map
